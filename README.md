# Golf Tournament Admin — Main Page

This is an initial static main page for the Golf Tournament Administration site. It includes three primary buttons: `Tournaments`, `Players`, and `Courses`.

Quick start (from the project root):

```bash
# Serve files on http://localhost:8000
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

What's included:
- `index.html` — landing page with three buttons and a small placeholder area.
- `styles.css` — simple responsive styles for the page.

Next steps:
- Implement pages / routes for tournaments, players, and courses.
- Add a build/dev toolchain (e.g., npm + Vite or Next.js) when you're ready.
