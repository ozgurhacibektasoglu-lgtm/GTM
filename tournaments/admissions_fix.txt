FOUND THE BUG - Line 374-379 in admissions.html has duplicate getTeeForPlayer() calls:

Current (BROKEN):
              <td>${player.club || player.homeClub || ''}</td>
                            <td>${getTeeForPlayer(player)}</td>
              <td>${formatHcp(player.hcp)}</td>
              <td>${calculatePlayingHcp(player)}</td>
                            <td>${getTeeForPlayer(player)}</td>
              <td>${player.gender || ''}</td>

Should be (FIXED):
              <td>${player.club || player.homeClub || ''}</td>
              <td>${getTeeForPlayer(player)}</td>
              <td>${formatHcp(player.hcp)}</td>
              <td>${calculatePlayingHcp(player)}</td>
              <td>${player.gender || ''}</td>

The duplicate Tee column is breaking the table rendering and causing players to disappear.

MANUAL FIX NEEDED:
1. Open /Users/ozgur/Desktop/GTM/tournaments/admissions.html
2. Go to line 374-379
3. Remove the duplicate line: <td>${getTeeForPlayer(player)}</td>
4. Keep only ONE getTeeForPlayer() call after Home Club column
5. Save and reload

Also check the admitted players table around line 390-400 for the same issue.
